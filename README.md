# üî• Lava Leap 
<b>Subtitle: How I finally understood ES6 Classes and Constructors!</b>
<br>
(Hint: it does not involve barking dogs!!!)

Lava Leap is a 2D platformer game implemented using vanilla JavaScript. The game features:
- player movement
- obstacles
- five levels
- lava patterns that the player has to avoid
- coins that the player has to collect in order to move to the next level
<br>

## üéÆ Game Flow
- Move your player using the arrow keys or the W, A, D keys. 
- The goal is to have it collect all the coins without making contact with the lava. Then it can progress to the next level.
- A collision with the lava means the level restarts.
- Should your player run out of lives or successfully complete all levels, the game will come to an end.
- Once the game has loaded, set the number of **lives** by adding a query parameter in the URL: `https://lava-leap.netlify.app/?lives=number`. Replace `number` with the desired number of lives. For example, `https://lava-leap.netlify.app/?lives=5` to start the game with 5 lives.



üí° Want an extra challenge or need some help? Adjust your player's number of lives directly in the URL.

üîÑ If you've run out of lives or completed all levels, I added end-of-game messages and a restart button so you can always try again!

## Why I Wanted to Create This Project
I am a self-taught developer focused on frontend and accessibility. For the longest time, ES6 Classes and Constructors just didn't make sense, and assumed they were some secret tools for backend developers. Fortunately, a tech meetup encounter with [Ean Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ean-moore-948357103), a Senior Software Engineer and game developer, changed my perspective. Ean is one of the most passionate JavaScript developers I've ever met! He spoke about game development with such enthusiasm that it sparked my curiosity ‚Äî even though I don't play video games!
<br>

## Code Source and Added Enhancements
This project began as a direct application from the "Eloquent JavaScript" book, which I then adapted to improve functionality and user experience. 

- used modules to restructure the codebase 
- added intro page and option to adjust the number of lives in the url
- added end-game messages and a restart button
- upgraded the color theme for better accessibility
- made game stats (level number, coins collected and coins remaining) available during play
<br>
And guess what? Now I know how to use the ‚ÄúConstructor‚Äù! 
<br>

## Upcoming Changes
Right now I'm working on adding some extra cool features and more game levels (although, I must admit, I keep getting stuck on level 2 ‚òπÔ∏è).
<br>

### 1. Gameplay Enhancements
- pause option between levels
- visual and sound effects during collisions
- a second player (should it be a Good one or a Bad one?! ü§î)
- option to adjust the speed of moving elements
<br>

### 2. Tooling Upgrades
- Migrating to TypeScript
- Setting Up Automated Testing for code quality and to prevent bugs.
<br>

## PS: A quick overview of all the (seven!) Classes and their roles:

1. **Level**: Represents the game level with a 2D grid of cells, specifying where walls, actors (e.g., player, lava, coins) are located.
2. **State**: Represents the current state of the game, including the current level, actors, and the game's status (e.g., playing, won, lost).
3. **Vector**: Represents 2D vectors and is used for position and movement calculations.
4. **Player**: Represents the player character, which can move around the game grid.
5. **Lava**: Represents the moving lava obstacles in the game. The lava can move horizontally, vertically, or even stay still.
6. **Coin**: Represents collectible items that the player needs to gather to win the level.
7. **DOMDisplay**: Renders the game's state to the DOM, making the game playable in a browser.
<br>
<br>Plus, various utility functions that assist in managing player input, game animation, and interactions between game entities.
